# "Phony" target to run our program. "Phony" means the target
#	doesn't name an actual file/folder, but an action to take
#
# Notice we have a dependency here.
# The "build" target is a dependency of the "run" target.
# We denote this by adding the build target's name
#	to the right of the run target's colon
# This means that whenever we execute the "run" target,
#	the "build" target gets ran first.
# This makes sense because we would want to be sure
#	our executable is built before trying to launch
#	the program.
run:	build

# Another "phony" target.
# Notice it depends on the executable $(BIN) being built
#	which will cause the target below to run.
# Notice also it doesn't actually do anything. This means
#	the "build" target is essentially an alias, or shortcut.
build:	$(BIN)
.PHONY: build


# A real (non-phony) target which names the executable
# Trace back up to the variables defined at the top of this file
#	and you'll see that $(BIN) just expands to ./main
# The job of this target is to build your entire program.
